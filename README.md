# Varenicline for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder
Varenicline for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis Denali Carpenter, Ridhika Agrawal, Yuyin Sun, and Jeff Jonkman Grinnell College

This repository contains a **systematic review and meta-analysis** exploring the effectiveness of varenicline for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). It examines three primary outcomes: 
1. **Percent Heavy Drinking Days**  
2. **Alcohol Cravings**  
3. **Adverse Events**

## Overview

**Objective**  
Assess whether varenicline (commonly used for smoking cessation) can help reduce heavy drinking days, decrease alcohol cravings, and identify any significant adverse events in adults with alcohol use disorder.

**Key Findings**  
- **Percent Heavy Drinking Days:** Showed a non-significant decrease overall, though exploratory analyses suggested possible reductions in certain subgroups.  
- **Alcohol Cravings:** Evidence pointed toward some reduction in cravings among those treated with varenicline.  
- **Adverse Events:** Nausea and abnormal/vivid dreams were significantly more likely with varenicline, aligning with known side effects from smoking-cessation studies.

**Limitations**  
- Studies were limited in duration and sample size.  
- Populations sampled were not broadly representative (e.g., mostly white, middle-aged men without severe comorbidities).  
- There was considerable variability in how outcomes (especially cravings) were measured.
